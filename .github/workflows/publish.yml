      # NPM_TOKEN must be a "Granular Access Token" or a classic "Automation"
      # token created on npmjs.com. Automation-type tokens bypass the npm 2FA
      # OTP prompt so that publishing works in CI even when
      # "Require 2FA for write actions" is enabled on your npm account.
      # See: https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens
      #
      # --provenance attaches a signed OIDC attestation so consumers can verify
      # that the package was built by this GitHub Actions workflow.
